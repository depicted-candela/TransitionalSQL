## 🎹 **1. Basic Query Tuning Considerations**

**Focus:** Learn the foundational principles of designing applications and writing SQL for optimal performance in an Oracle environment. This section moves beyond just syntax to the strategic thinking required for efficient data access.

**📚 Core Reading Materials:**

*   *Oracle® Database Performance Tuning Guide* [`ch02_2-designing-and-developing-for-performance.pdf`](./books/database-performance-tuning-guide/ch02_2-designing-and-developing-for-performance.pdf)
    *   **Why it's essential:** This chapter is the perfect starting point. It covers the philosophy of performance tuning, including crucial topics like Data Modeling, Table and Index Design, and Application Design Principles. It provides the "why" behind the tuning techniques you'll learn later.

*   *Oracle® Database SQL Tuning Guide* [`ch02_2-sql-performance-methodology.pdf`](./books/sql-tuning-guide/ch02_2-sql-performance-methodology.pdf)
    *   **Why it's essential:** This chapter provides a structured, repeatable process for identifying and resolving SQL performance issues. It establishes a professional methodology, moving you from ad-hoc fixes to systematic tuning.

## 📊 **2. Table Statistics & DBMS_STATS**

**Focus:** Understand why statistics are the lifeblood of Oracle's Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO). Learn about the different types of statistics and the importance of keeping them up-to-date to ensure Oracle chooses the most efficient execution plan for your queries.

**📚 Core Reading Materials:**

*   *Oracle® Database SQL Tuning Guide* [`ch01_10-optimizer-statistics-concepts.pdf`](./books/sql-tuning-guide/ch01_10-optimizer-statistics-concepts.pdf)
    *   **Why it's essential:** This is the definitive chapter on the theory and concepts of optimizer statistics. It explains what they are, why they are critical, and how the optimizer uses them to make decisions about execution plans. A deep understanding of this material is non-negotiable for serious performance tuning.

*   *Database Performance Tuning Guide* [`ch02_6-gathering-database-statistics.pdf`](./books/database-performance-tuning-guide/ch02_6-gathering-database-statistics.pdf)
    *   **Why it's essential:** This chapter transitions from theory to practice, introducing the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) and the automated mechanisms Oracle uses to gather statistics. It provides the context for how `DBMS_STATS` is used in a modern database environment.

## 📌 **3. Optimizer Hints**

**Focus:** Learn how to manually influence the Oracle optimizer's decisions. While the CBO is highly sophisticated, there are cases where providing "hints" can force a better execution plan. This section emphasizes awareness and cautious, deliberate use.

**📚 Core Reading Materials:**

*   *Oracle® Database SQL Tuning Guide* [`ch01_19-influencing-the-optimizer.pdf`](./books/sql-tuning-guide/ch01_19-influencing-the-optimizer.pdf)
    *   **Why it's essential:** This is the primary and most authoritative chapter on influencing the optimizer. It covers not only the syntax and application of various hints but also the other levers you can pull, like initialization parameters. It's a comprehensive guide to taking control when you need to.

## ✨ **4. Oracle 23ai Performance Features**

**Focus:** Get up to speed with the latest intelligent, automated performance and diagnostic features in Oracle 23ai. These tools represent the future of Oracle tuning, automating tasks that were previously manual and complex.

**📚 Core Reading Materials:**

*   *Oracle Database 23ai New Features Guide* [`10_OLTP_and_Core_Database.pdf`](./books/oracle-database-23ai-new-features-guide/10_OLTP_and_Core_Database.pdf)
    *   **Why it's essential:** This chapter details **Real-Time SQL Plan Management**, a game-changing feature that automatically detects and corrects performance regressions caused by execution plan changes. It's a key selling point and a powerful tool for maintaining application stability.

*   *Oracle Database 23ai New Features Guide* [`11_Diagnosability.pdf`](./books/oracle-database-23ai-new-features-guide/11_Diagnosability.pdf)
    *   **Why it's essential:** This chapter introduces the **SQL Analysis Report**, a new diagnostic tool that helps developers and DBAs quickly identify and resolve common SQL performance problems. It's a practical, hands-on feature that accelerates the tuning process.
