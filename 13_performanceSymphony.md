# 🎼 Study Chunk 13: Performance Symphony: Tuning Oracle with Hints and Stats
**Parental/Core Category:** ORACLE PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION BASICS

Welcome to the conductor's podium. This chunk is about mastering the art of SQL performance tuning. You will learn how to read the Oracle Optimizer's mind through execution plans, guide its decisions with hints, and ensure it has the best information (statistics) to work with. The goal is to transform slow, dissonant queries into a fast, harmonious performance.

## 🎹 Core Concepts & Techniques

Here are the essential topics for this chunk, linked directly to the most relevant chapters in your documentation.

### 🧠 Basic Query Tuning Considerations
Understanding the "why" behind query performance is the first step. This involves adopting a structured methodology and recognizing how application design impacts SQL execution.

*   *Oracle® Database Performance Tuning Guide, 23ai* [Chapter 2: Designing and Developing for Performance](./reduction-of-Oracle®-Database-Database-Performance-Tuning-Guide,-23ai.md#page=3)
*   *Oracle® Database Performance Tuning Guide, 23ai* [Chapter 3: Performance Improvement Methods](./reduction-of-Oracle®-Database-Database-Performance-Tuning-Guide,-23ai.md#page=4)
*   *Oracle® Database SQL Tuning Guide, 23ai* [Chapter 2: SQL Performance Methodology](./reduction-of-Oracle®-Database-SQL-Tuning-Guide,-23ai.md#page=3)

#### 👉 Optimizer Hints
Hints are directives you embed in SQL to influence the optimizer's execution plan. While powerful, they should be used judiciously when you have more information than the optimizer.

*   *Oracle® Database SQL Tuning Guide, 23ai* [Chapter 19: Influencing the Optimizer](./reduction-of-Oracle®-Database-SQL-Tuning-Guide,-23ai.md#page=15)

### 📊 Table Statistics & DBMS_STATS
The Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO) is only as good as the data it has. Statistics provide the CBO with critical information about your data's size and distribution. `DBMS_STATS` is your toolkit for managing them.
