## Prerequisites

*   Solid understanding of SQL, particularly PostgreSQL syntax and concepts.
*   Familiarity with relational database concepts (tables, joins, keys, etc.).
*   Basic programming concepts (variables, loops, conditionals) are beneficial, though PL/SQL basics are covered.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:

*   Understand and utilize Oracle-specific SQL syntax and data types.
*   Write proficient PL/SQL code, including anonymous blocks, stored procedures, functions, packages, and triggers.
*   Handle data effectively using Oracle's DML, transaction control, and advanced querying techniques like hierarchical queries and analytic functions.
*   Work with complex data types, particularly XML, within Oracle.
*   Understand and apply Oracle-specific concepts like the DUAL table, ROWNUM, and various Oracle functions.
*   Manage exceptions and use collections in PL/SQL.
*   Implement performance-enhancing techniques like bulk operations.
