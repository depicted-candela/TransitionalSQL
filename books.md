**General Note:**
*   The **`Oracle Database 23ai New Features Guide`** will be a recurring important reference for *any* chunk that mentions "Oracle 23ai Feature".
*   Many concepts are covered in multiple books, but I'll try to point to the primary or most developer-focused ones.
*   "Influential" means books that provide core understanding. "Important" means directly relevant to the chunk's specific topics or your job role.
